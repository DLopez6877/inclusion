Using various API’s and other tools available, we want to try and start a conversation based on facts about equality in the tech workforce. We have developed a handy guide to help you learn more about where you stand in the industry, and to supply you with a way to connect with others like you. Breaking into the the tech industry can be extremely difficult, let alone if you are a woman or a minority. We believe the more facts you have available to you about certain inequalities you might be up against, the better equipped you will be to fight them and make your place in the tech world. Knowledge is power, and we are dedicated to using this knowledge to help make sure everyone feels included. </p><h3>Lets Get Started</h3><div class="form-control"><h5>Choose which jobs you are interested in</h5></div><div class="checkboxes"><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer support specialists" value="151150" id="151150"/><label for="151150">Computer support specialists</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer programmers" value="151131" id="151131"/><label for="151131">Computer programmers</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer systems analysts" value="151121" id="151121"/><label for="151121">Computer systems analysts</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Database administrators" value="151141" id="151141"/><label for="151141">Database administrators</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer hardware engineers" value="172061" id="172061"/><label for="172061">Computer hardware engineers</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer network architects" value="151143" id="151143"/><label for="151143">Computer network architects</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer &amp; information research scientists" value="151111" id="151111"/><label for="151111">Computer &amp; information research scientists</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Software developers, applications &amp; systems software" value="15113X" id="15113X"/><label for="15113X">Software developers, applications &amp; systems software</label><div class="box-control"></div></div><div class="checkbox-inline"><input class="occupation" type="checkbox" name="Computer control programmers and operators" value="514010" id="514010"/><label for="514010">Computer control programmers and operators</label><div class="box-control"></div></div></div><div class="form-control"><h5>Now, what group are you interested in</h5></div></div><div class="graph-selections"><div class="graph-selection" id="age"> <img src="./assets/images/icon-age.png"/><div class="descriptions"><h4>AGE</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to learn more information about how which age groups are more likely hired for specific jobs.</p></div></div><div class="graph-selection" id="gender"><img src="./assets/images/icon-gender.png"/><div class="descriptions"><h4>GENDER</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to learn more about gender inequality in the tech industry, and which jobs are more likely to hire a woman vs a man.</p></div></div><div class="graph-selection" id="ethnicity"><img src="./assets/images/icon-ethnicity.png"/><div class="descriptions"><h4>ETHNICITY</h4><p>Click this group if you would like to know more about how your race/ethnicity compares to others when it comes to finding jobs in the tech industry.</p></div></div></div><button class="go">Go!</button></section><section id="about-section"><h3>About<p>The Inclusion team is made up of four Epicodus CSS/Design interns at ScoutSavvy and project management intern who fromally worked on the business team at Apple.

I like to create, problem solve, and ask why. I’m all about growing, and lifting up those around me. And my dogs, I’m all about my dogs.</p><p>I love clean and minimalistic websites that achieve a level of depth. I tend to stick with gentle and neutral colors, but I also love challenging myself and thinking outside the box.</p></div><div class="bio"><img src="./assets/images/maria.jpg"/><h4>Maria Del Castillo</h4><h5>Designer</h5><p>I’m a current CSS/Design student at Epicodus after years of working in various trades, ranging from music composition and production to hospitality to user support for a nation-wide tech company.</p><p>My passion for front-end development is in UX/UI. Being a lifelong visual artist substantially informs my creative process in web design.</p><p><a href="https://rawgit.com/mfdi86/CSS-week-4-project/master/index.html">portfolio</a></p></div></div><div class="bio-control"><div class="bio"><img src="./assets/images/daniel.jpg"/><h4>Daniel Lopez</h4><h5>Developer</h5><p>I am a front-end web developer and full-time geek. I spend most of my time inside my humble abode, in front of my computer, in Vancouver, WA. I have a strong passion for web devlopment and enjoy learning new technologies.</p><p>I'm excited to learn more about development and engineering in the future and hope to eventually work with big data, machine learning, ai, and other advanced concepts. As of right now, I am trying to improve my JavaScript skills by doing one project euler problem a day on my <a href="https://codepen.io/DLopez6877/">codepen</a>.</p><p>I'm a big soccer fan and enjoy playing Fifa on the Xbox or rocket league (soccer with cars). Favorite teams are Portland Timbers and Atlanta United. I recently picked up the hobby of simple robotics using arduino boards and enjoy watching movies / tv shows. </p><p>My favorite show right now is between Rick and Morty and Stranger things but I also highly recommend Mindhunter on Netflix. Also super excited for Ready Player One to come out!</p><p><a href="http://www.daniel-j-lopez.com">portfolio</a></p></div><div class="bio"><img src="./assets/images/karina.jpg"/><h4>Karina Roush</h4><h5>Designer</h5><p>I am currently a UX intern at ScoutSavvy working with a small team to utilize data and data visualization to tell a story about diversity in the tech industry. I am very close to graduating as a student at Epicodus, where I have been fine tuning my skills in front end web development and web design.</p><p>What really drew me to UX/UI was being able to mesh my artistic creativity with my expertise in customer service to create a positive experience for users to interact with. I love being able to create a website or app that can be extremely functional and serve a purpose, but is also beautiful, inspiring, and artistic.</p><p>When I am not playing with Sketch or InVision I am usually outside with friends taking pictures and enjoying the rainy Oregon weather, or inside with my cats and boyfriend watching Netflix.</p><p>I am actively looking for a long term career centered around UX/UI design in the Portland area. Let's design together!</p><p><a href="http://www.karinaroush.com">portfolio</a></p></div></div><div class="bio"><img src="./assets/images/jonathan.jpg"/><h4>Jonathan Ruffner</h4><h5>Project Manager</h5><p>As a Certified Scrum Product Owner and Certified Scrum Master, Jonathan enjoys the challenge of discovering and translating the ideas and needs of clients into products and services that maximize the ROI for all stakeholders.
